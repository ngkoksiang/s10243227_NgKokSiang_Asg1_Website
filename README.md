Name: My Personal Blog

Initially before i made this website, i wanted to make something that represented myself well and something that i would be proud of. i searched for inspiration and found a few that peaked my interest, i decided to make my blog about my interests and also one where i can expand my socials.
I wanted to share about my experiences and allow for people to hear about them and perhaps develop the same interest.
The website has a few pages.

I chose dark colours and similar colours for the buttons to keep things consistent and easy to look at.
The menu is meant to look simplistic as it offers a clean look to users.
As a classmate, I want to be able to know my friend well.
As a colleage, I want to be able to understand who I am working with and what his personality is like.
As a friend, I would like to get to know him better, understand his preferences and hobbies.

/Features/
Firstly, the homepage consists of new things that i have uploaded, the homepage allows you to go to the about page, forum page and contact page.
The about page leads to a page where i give a brief description of myself and my favourite things like food, colour, games, and  sport.
Forum page is where the articles that i have written would be at, and users can click on it and read about them. the articles are mainly of things that I have interest in such as games and powerlifting.
Finally, for the contact page, it is where the users can find my socials, and allow for me to hopefully expand my connections.

Technologies used:
Visual studio code, javascript, Github, html, css

/Challenges faced/
Unlike using a pen and paper to draw and write on a piece of paper, I cannot control where I want the html elements to appear on the screen. Whether it will be in a new line, or right next to each other, I can only tell through trial and error. This made HTML and CSS really hard to code as I had limited experience and could not fully control how the website looks. The website I drafted out on another application looked better than what I could do with HTML and CSS. To improve on this, I will learn more about HTML and CSS positioning such as the different variation of the display property and spacing such as padding and margin.

/Inspiration/
I got the inspiration from a mix of the different personal blogs I have encountered before, and also from the documentation page of amazon. I took inspiration from documentation sites as they are websites that contain large amount of text and that is a feature that will be present in my personal blog. I wanted to find existing examples of web pages that are already designed to hold large amount of text to lessen the burden of coming up with new ideas.
