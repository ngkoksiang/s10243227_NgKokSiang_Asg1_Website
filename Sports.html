            <p style="font-size:40px;"> Powerlifting</p>
            </b>
            <p>Powerlifting is a strength sport that consists of three attempts at maximal weight on three lifts: squat, bench press, and deadlift. As in the sport of Olympic weightlifting, it involves the athlete attempting a maximal weight single-lift effort of a barbell loaded with weight plates. Powerlifting evolved from a sport known as "odd lifts", which followed the same three-attempt format but used a wider variety of events, akin to strongman competition. Eventually odd lifts became standardized to the current three.</p>

            <p> Favourite Competition: IPF Worlds </p>
            </b>
            <p>The International Powerlifting Federation is an international governing body for the sport of powerlifting as recognized by the General Association of International Sports Federations (GAISF).

                The IPF was founded in 1972, and comprises member federations from more than one hundred countries with new ones being added yearly. The current IPF president is Gaston Parage, from Luxembourg. The first president of the federation was Robert Christ. The IPF is the largest powerlifting federation in the world.
                
                IPF is a drug-tested powerlifting federation that restricts supportive equipment in both equipped and raw competitions to an approved list which is updated from time to time.[1] Typically in equipped competition the usage is limited to single-ply polyester shirts and suits with wrist and knee wraps while soft suits and neoprene knee sleeves are permitted in the classic powerlifting division (referred to as unequipped or raw competition).</p>
